Before you make a custom level, here are some things you need to know:

Every character (besides the spaces) corresponds to a grid space. PLEASE keep the spaces in when you 
edit this, they are needed so that the code knows when to move on to another grid space.

The current key for all of the objects in the game goes as follows:
s: the default spike
b: the default block
h: the flat spike
-: empty space. The program will not work if there is not exactly a 10x1000 grid in the text file, 
so these are used to fill in the extra space. Don't get rid of them unless you are replacing them 
with one of the objects listed above.

The level you want to load into the game must be named exactly this: custom level.txt
The song you want to load into the game must be named exactly this: custom song.ogg
If you had an mp3 or some other audio file and you renamed it to a .ogg it will not work. 
You need to convert it to an ogg file. There are several free online converters that you can use, 
and they don’t take very long.

You can have several extra text and audio files in the same folder as the levels and it won’t affect anything.

I strongly discourage using custom images to replace the icon, spikes, background, etc. You can do it if you are
brave, determined, and/or stupid, but it can easily get out of control and mess up the visuals.
