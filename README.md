This program is designed to replicate the mobile game Geometry Dash by
RobTopGames using SFML. This was my final project for my introductory C++
class

Geometry Dash is NOT made, designed, or published by me. The same thing can be
said about the soundracks used, those being Stereo Madness by ForeverBound, and
March of the Spoons by Kevin McCloud. This recreation was made as a personal
project to test myself with SFML and C++, and not for any sort of personal 
gain or profit.

all of that out of the way, I need to say a few things.

1) Thank you for checking this out. This project means a lot to me, I spent a month and a half
