This program is designed to replicate the mobile game Geometry Dash by
RobTopGames using SFML. This was my final project for my introductory C++
class

Geometry Dash is NOT made, designed, or published by me. The same thing can be
said about the soundracks used, those being Stereo Madness by ForeverBound, and
March of the Spoons by Kevin McCloud. This recreation was made as a personal
project to test myself with SFML and C++, and not for any sort of personal 
gain or profit.

all of that out of the way, I need to say a few things.

1) Thank you for checking this out. This project means a lot to me, I spent a month and a half solid fine-tuning this to look as good as I could get it.
2) I'm not the best programmer, but keep in mind that this was for a school project. We had learned about classes already before starting the project, but since we had not talked about inheritance, I didnt want to use it here, which would have made any classes I would have wanted a lot more tedious.
3) This uses SFML, if you want to try building it yourself for one reason or another, make sure you have that installed and the properties configured correctly.
4) There is another README in the folder with all of the files, read that if you want to switch up the custom level and/or song.
5) enjoy! :D
